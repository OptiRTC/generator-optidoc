# generator-optidoc 

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for [OptiRTC](https://github.com/OptiRTC) user interface component documentation.

## Getting Started

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed.

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Install generator-optidoc

Finally, change your command line directory to the to the root level of the OptiRTC javascript application you want to generate documentation for and initiate the generator:
